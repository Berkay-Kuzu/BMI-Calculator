# BMI-Calculator
  BMI Calculator is an app which the users can calculate their body mass index in terms of BMI values. The users can calculate their BMI values by using height slider and weight sliders and then when they clicked the calculate button, they can see their result. 
  In this app, first of all, I benefited from MVC(Model-View-Controller) model to put in order the app. To be more precise, CalculatorBrain and BMI files are in Models folder. Views folder has Main file. As for Controllers file, CalculateViewController and ResultViewController are located in this file. CalculatorBrain as its name signifies is the brain of the calculation. In this file, there is a struct called CalculatorBrain and calcualateBMI function which includes the advices the users are going to see when they calculate their BMI value is written here. Also, in this file, there is a BMI file which includes struct that indicates the data type of value, advice, and color. As for Views folder, there is a Main file which indicates the design of the app. Last but not least, in the Controllers file, there are CalculateViewController and ResultViewController files which point out much more complex calculation and the appearance of result screen. In addition to all, I benefited from Nil Coalescing Operator.
